# My Personal Site

Welcome to my personal site! This is where I document my journey in technology, share insights from my homelab, and showcase the projects I've taken on. Additionally, I maintain a self-documentation wiki to keep track of everything I've learned and implemented.

## Sections

### 1. Technology Journal
In this section, I write about the latest technologies I'm exploring, tutorials I've found useful, and my thoughts on various tech trends.

### 2. Homelab
Here, I document the setup, configuration, and management of my homelab. This includes hardware specs, network topologies, and various services I run at home.

### 3. Projects
A showcase of my personal and professional projects. This includes detailed write-ups, source code, and deployment instructions where applicable.

### 4. Self-Documentation Wiki
A comprehensive wiki where I document all the technical knowledge I acquire. This serves as a reference for myself and others who might find the information useful.
